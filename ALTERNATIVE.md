In the interest of having contrast, there cannot be a echo chamber. The echo chamber is part of what has gotten us here

Are we mad about the Trump election? Yes

But can we try to understand issues? In particular, I would like to highlight what I think are legitamate aspects of conservative thinking.

## Thomas Sowell columns


Thomas Sowell is a conservative thought columnist. His book "Basic Economics: A Common Sense Guide to the Economy" is a good book with extremely simple that hammer home libertarian type ideas.

Since Trump was elected, he has retired from his columnist post https://www.creators.com/read/thomas-sowell/12/16/farewell

Nevertheless, he had some good coverage of the election:


* Video about housing, obamacare, military https://www.bloomberg.com/politics/videos/2016-12-15/hoover-institution-s-sowell-on-trump-obamacare-military
* Article saying that "Impeaching trump would be easier than Hillary", sort of a jab http://www.eastbaytimes.com/2016/10/28/sowell-choose-trump-hes-much-easier-to-impeach/
* Addressing tough topics about ISIS proliferation http://www.nationalreview.com/article/440928/donald-trump-tape-indefensible-hillary-clinton-actions-matter-most

## Policies

## Education

Betsy DeVos's nomination is controversial to many

I did not know about her previously but have seen great outrage over the idea of school choice. Her being from Michigan, there is a long history of school choice causing sytematic societal problems. Many assert that forcing bussing children over school lines would have prevented white flight in Detroit, MI, the state where she is from. She advocates the charter school system within Detroit, MI, which is problematic because the public school system is in complete shambles, see Dan Rather's - A National Disgrace about this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xypiZ-hqdY

Is it OK to advocate for an alternative when the status-quo, especially in Detroit, is not working? Sure. However it is easy to see that there are still huge problems https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betsy_DeVos#Detroit_charter_school_system
