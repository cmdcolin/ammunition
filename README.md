Trump meets with Andrew Wakefield, vaccine opponent
http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2016/11/trump-met-prominent-anti-vaccine-activists-during-campaign


Wakefield advocated chelating chemicals (chemicals which remove heavy metals from body) to cure children of autism, but those chemicals themselves are much less studied and likely more harmful on children

Wakefield also advocated MMS (Miracle Mineral Supplement) which is effectively bleach, and parents used it on children http://www.forbes.com/sites/emilywillingham/2016/03/11/autism-parents-still-buying-into-bleach-cure-from-self-described-space-alien-god/#799a69f870de

Quotes about MMS

    "My daughter vomits every day now. We have been on cd [Kerri Riveraâ€™s term for the bleach "treatment" of chlorine dioxide] for 2 months-and since 1 month she is vomiting, almost every day. Sometimes twice, today 3 times! Have any of you had this?"

    "...my son [redacted], 10 yrs old. Seems to want to vomit at the very end of each enema these days. Why is this? We put 10 ml of cd in his enema."



## News organizations

Coverage by news organizations of the electron was heavily disproportionately Trump, giving him 1.4 million references to 0.6 million Clinton references http://television.gdeltproject.org/cgi-bin/iatv_campaign2016/iatv_campaign2016

They even often let him speak on air much more than Hillary

The media may have done this thinking that Trump would dig his own grave with his rants, but that is absolutely deplorable of media organizations to think this, and in fact, it of course backfired and gave Trump the nomination and the presidency


## Climate change

Obviously technologically inclined, he deletes references to the climate change section of the whitehouse website http://www.newsweek.com/white-house-drops-climate-change-info-web-546010


## Trade policy

Trump's perspective on trade policy is extremely insular and lends itself to cronyism

## Insane twitter trolls

### Calling for people to harrass public health figures https://twitter.com/Ellsworth_Lies

All Autism & Vaccine Injured peeps, Please Tweet this "Expert" @PeterHotez that coincidentally works for Vaccine Manufacturers:

Meanwhile Peter Hotez is actually a neglected tropical disease researcher who is not funded by "vaccine manufacturers"

Every post that is anti-trump will have trump defenders harrassing everyone who replies to the post, and those trump defenders posts will be highly ranked in the replies list

### Mislabeled getty images rant


```
 @JoannaSimkin has she ran for President? No? Then why TF would anybody know who she is, much less give a fuck to find out

 @wschamps2023 @JoannaSimkin @GettyImages buys images and identifies people in them as a business model. I'd hope they would "give a fuck"

 @newmanj12 @JoannaSimkin @GettyImages you say that like I should "give a fuck" about the media

 @wschamps2023 your lack of intellectual curiosity is unsurprising to say the least

 @newmanj12 ZING! Wow! Feel better sweetheart?

 @wschamps2023 I do feel pretty good, thanks!

 @newmanj12 don't ever forget how wrong you were/are about the election so next time it's not such a crushing defeat

 @wschamps2023 unsure what I was/am wrong about, but thank you for the friendly reminder <3

This remains the top comment thread on a twitter post with 28000 likes even though the exchange is repulsive to read. There is no downvote functionality on twitter to make this go away, and so this uncivilized troll behavior is encouraged ad nauseum all over twitter

## Insane reddit trolls

/r/The_Donald subreddit is completely obnoxious in it's behavior, using tons of "alt-right" in-group memes, and harrassing people with sexual innuendos like cuck/cuckold. That type of behavior is absolutely revolting, and reddit admins would rather shut their community down but they are also strongly in support of free speech so they allow it. Nevertheless, it is fully within their rights to shut it down.
