A short database of deplorable things that Trump and his cronies do


## Enabling "The Mexico City policy"

Non-governmental aid organizations that receive funds for family planning cannot discuss abortion in ruling

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico_City_Policy

It was of course re-enabled by Trump on his first Monday in office: https://www.buzzfeed.com/jinamoore/trump-just-slapped-an-anti-abortion-rule-on-foreign-aid?bftwnews&utm_term=.sl53GprkX#.rd3PEMbjr



## Anti-vaxx stance

Nominating Robert Kennedy Jr. to made-up committee to investigate "vaccine safety and scientific integrety"
https://theintercept.com/2017/01/10/trump-names-anti-vaccine-activist-robert-kennedy-jr-lead-panel-vaccine-safety/

Trump meets with Andrew Wakefield, a now infamous figure in anti-vaxx movement
http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2016/11/trump-met-prominent-anti-vaccine-activists-during-campaign https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Wakefield
 

The anti-vaxx stance is very harmful for public health and safety, with a large increase in people believing in non-medical and personal-belief exemptions to vaccines http://www.motherjones.com/environment/2014/02/vaccine-exemptions-states-pertussis-map and giving their kids DIY medical treatments like MMS ("Miracle Mineral Supplement") or heavy-metal chelation therapy.

## Coverage of the elections was Trump biased

Coverage by news organizations of the 2016 election was heavily biased towards talking about Trump, giving him 1.4 million references to 0.6 million Clinton references http://television.gdeltproject.org/cgi-bin/iatv_campaign2016/iatv_campaign2016

They also used audio clips or video clips of Trump talking much more often than Hillary

My opinion is that this resulted in a "any publicity is good publicity effect", but there is likely more subtlety to it.

Maybe the media thought that Trump's ridiculous claims and rants would dig his own grave, but it is very wrong to think this, and in fact, it of course backfired and gave Trump the nomination and the presidency


## Climate change

Obviously technologically inclined, he deletes references to the climate change section of the whitehouse website http://www.newsweek.com/white-house-drops-climate-change-info-web-546010

Scientists have, since the election, started backing up reems of climate science data in order to stave off dangerous policies that might delete them. https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2016/12/13/scientists-are-frantically-copying-u-s-climate-data-fearing-it-might-vanish-under-trump/?utm_term=.9bd244cdf19e


## Trade policy

Trump's perspective on trade policy is extremely insular and lends itself to cronyism

## Insane twitter trolls

Many posts on twitter, regardless of topic, will have Trump defenders harrassing everyone who replies to the post, and those Trump defenders posts will be highly ranked in the replies list



### Mislabeled getty images rant


```
 @JoannaSimkin has she ran for President? No? Then why TF would anybody know who she is, much less give a fuck to find out

 @wschamps2023 @JoannaSimkin @GettyImages buys images and identifies people in them as a business model. I'd hope they would "give a fuck"

 @newmanj12 @JoannaSimkin @GettyImages you say that like I should "give a fuck" about the media

 @wschamps2023 your lack of intellectual curiosity is unsurprising to say the least

 @newmanj12 ZING! Wow! Feel better sweetheart?

 @wschamps2023 I do feel pretty good, thanks!

 @newmanj12 don't ever forget how wrong you were/are about the election so next time it's not such a crushing defeat

 @wschamps2023 unsure what I was/am wrong about, but thank you for the friendly reminder <3
```

This remains the top comment thread on a twitter post with 28000 likes even though the exchange is repulsive to read. There is no downvote functionality on twitter to make this go away, and so this uncivilized troll behavior is encouraged ad nauseum all over twitter

### Anti-vaxx people harrassing public health figures https://twitter.com/Ellsworth_Lies

Tweets saying such things as "All Autism & Vaccine Injured peeps, Please Tweet this "Expert" @PeterHotez that coincidentally works for Vaccine Manufacturers"




## Insane reddit trolls

/r/The_Donald subreddit is completely obnoxious in it's behavior, using tons of "alt-right" in-group memes, and harrassing people with sexual innuendos like cuck/cuckold.

Reddit admins have in the past had trouble with obnoxious communities on reddit, and oftentimes if an obnoxious community is shut down, other look-a-like subreddits popup and get to the front page using bots or vote manipulations causing havoc https://www.reddit.com/r/ListOfSubreddits/wiki/banned



## "Muslim ban/database"

Trump has repeatedly brought up the idea of a ban on Muslim immigration or a database of Muslim immigrants. Or, maybe as this article suggests, the press is putting words in his mouth, but he certainly doesn't protest or clarify https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/11/17/the-evolution-of-donald-trump-and-the-muslim-database/?utm_term=.8d339dce2029

The targetting of religion, which has no national or ethnic boundary, is just mindboggling, whether it is a database or a ban on immigration.

It seems to me to be some sort of way to send a message to extreme Islamic groups like ISIS, but the reality of it is extremely Nazi-ish, name-and-shame-ish, and demoralizing.

Think that this type of thing would not happen in reality? The TSA already, beginning with Obama administration, will ask for social media handles on your immigration forms.

Crossing borders is becoming increasingly invasive of your personal privacy.

## Russian connection

I believe the story of Trump's Putin/Russian connection which has emerged since Trump was elected is dubious and perhaps a manufactured news item which is largely irrelevant. It would seem that the connection normalizes USA-Russian relations and also normalizes widespread hacking (which is troublesome as large scale computer hacking is affecting more and more people, e.g. the 1,000,000,000 account Yahoo! leak)


## "Build the wall"

The idea of building a wall could be said to be the bedrock of Trump's campaign. "Build the wall" gets Trump supporters so excited that they chant about it, which is ultimately really cringeworthy.

From the desk of the current out-going USA Border chief, "it is not going to work" either http://www.mediaite.com/online/outgoing-border-chief-trumps-wall-is-a-waste-of-resources-thats-not-going-to-work/


## Crude and sexist commentary

Trump does not shy away from saying disgusting things about women. I would advise not even clicking this link for your own sanity http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/16-real-things-trump-has-said-about-women-while-for-running-for-president_us_57e14a5ae4b04a1497b6a29c


This NYT article discusses what this type of thing means https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/09/us/politics/men-say-trumps-remarks-on-sex-and-women-are-beyond-the-pale.html<Paste>

A reasonable conclusion this article makes is that this is not normal banter. It's really deplorable. Did we really need the NYT to tell us this though?
