Trump meets with Andrew Wakefield, vaccine opponent

Wakefield advocated chelating chemicals (chemicals which remove heavy metals from body) to cure children of autism, but those chemicals themselves are much less studied and likely more harmful on children

Wakefield also advocated MMS (Miracle Mineral Supplement) which is effectively bleach, and parents used it on children http://www.forbes.com/sites/emilywillingham/2016/03/11/autism-parents-still-buying-into-bleach-cure-from-self-described-space-alien-god/#799a69f870de

Quotes about MMS

    "My daughter vomits every day now. We have been on cd [Kerri Riveraâ€™s term for the bleach "treatment" of chlorine dioxide] for 2 months-and since 1 month she is vomiting, almost every day. Sometimes twice, today 3 times! Have any of you had this?"

    "...my son [redacted], 10 yrs old. Seems to want to vomit at the very end of each enema these days. Why is this? We put 10 ml of cd in his enema."



## News organizations

Coverage by news organizations was heavily disproportionately Trump, giving him 1.4 million references to 600 thousand Clinton references

They even often let him speak on air much more than Hillary

The media may have done this thinking that Trump would dig his own grave with his rants, but that is absolutely deplorable of media organizations to think this, and in fact, it of course backfired and gave Trump the nomination and the presidency
