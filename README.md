A short database of deplorable things that Trump and his cronies do


## Enabling "The Mexico City policy"

Non-governmental aid organizations that receive funds for family planning cannot discuss abortion in ruling

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico_City_Policy

It was of course re-enabled by Trump on his first Monday in office: https://www.buzzfeed.com/jinamoore/trump-just-slapped-an-anti-abortion-rule-on-foreign-aid?bftwnews&utm_term=.sl53GprkX#.rd3PEMbjr



## Anti-vaxx stance

Nominating Robert Kennedy Jr. to made-up committee to investigate "vaccine safety and scientific integrety"

Trump meets with Andrew Wakefield, a now infamous figure in anti-vaxx movement
http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2016/11/trump-met-prominent-anti-vaccine-activists-during-campaign https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Wakefield
 

The anti-vaxx stance is very harmful for public health and safety, with a large increase in people believing in non-medical and personal-belief exemptions to vaccines http://www.motherjones.com/environment/2014/02/vaccine-exemptions-states-pertussis-map and giving their kids DIY medical treatments like MMS ("Miracle Mineral Supplement") or heavy-metal chelation therapy.

## News organizations coverage of the elections was Trump biased

Coverage by news organizations of the electron was heavily disproportionately Trump, giving him 1.4 million references to 0.6 million Clinton references http://television.gdeltproject.org/cgi-bin/iatv_campaign2016/iatv_campaign2016

They even often let him speak on air much more than Hillary

The media may have done this thinking that Trump would dig his own grave with his rants, but that is absolutely deplorable of media organizations to think this, and in fact, it of course backfired and gave Trump the nomination and the presidency


## Climate change

Obviously technologically inclined, he deletes references to the climate change section of the whitehouse website http://www.newsweek.com/white-house-drops-climate-change-info-web-546010

Scientists have, since the election, started backing up reems of climate science data in order to stave off dangerous policies that might delete them. https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2016/12/13/scientists-are-frantically-copying-u-s-climate-data-fearing-it-might-vanish-under-trump/?utm_term=.9bd244cdf19e


## Trade policy

Trump's perspective on trade policy is extremely insular and lends itself to cronyism

## Insane twitter trolls

Many posts on twitter, regardless of topic, will have Trump defenders harrassing everyone who replies to the post, and those Trump defenders posts will be highly ranked in the replies list



### Mislabeled getty images rant


```
 @JoannaSimkin has she ran for President? No? Then why TF would anybody know who she is, much less give a fuck to find out

 @wschamps2023 @JoannaSimkin @GettyImages buys images and identifies people in them as a business model. I'd hope they would "give a fuck"

 @newmanj12 @JoannaSimkin @GettyImages you say that like I should "give a fuck" about the media

 @wschamps2023 your lack of intellectual curiosity is unsurprising to say the least

 @newmanj12 ZING! Wow! Feel better sweetheart?

 @wschamps2023 I do feel pretty good, thanks!

 @newmanj12 don't ever forget how wrong you were/are about the election so next time it's not such a crushing defeat

 @wschamps2023 unsure what I was/am wrong about, but thank you for the friendly reminder <3
```

This remains the top comment thread on a twitter post with 28000 likes even though the exchange is repulsive to read. There is no downvote functionality on twitter to make this go away, and so this uncivilized troll behavior is encouraged ad nauseum all over twitter

https://twitter.com/JoannaSimkin/status/823189530597584897

### Anti-vaxx people harrassing public health figures https://twitter.com/Ellsworth_Lies

Tweets saying such things as "All Autism & Vaccine Injured peeps, Please Tweet this "Expert" @PeterHotez that coincidentally works for Vaccine Manufacturers"




## Insane reddit trolls

/r/The_Donald subreddit is completely obnoxious in it's behavior, using tons of "alt-right" in-group memes, and harrassing people with sexual innuendos like cuck/cuckold.

Reddit admins have in the past had trouble with obnoxious communities on reddit, and oftentimes if an obnoxious community is shut down, other look-a-like subreddits popup and get to the front page using bots or vote manipulations causing havoc https://www.reddit.com/r/ListOfSubreddits/wiki/banned



## "Muslim ban/database"

Trump has repeatedly brought up the idea of a ban on Muslim immigration or a database of Muslim immigrants. Or, maybe as this article suggests, the press is putting words in his mouth, but he certainly doesn't protest or clarify https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/11/17/the-evolution-of-donald-trump-and-the-muslim-database/?utm_term=.8d339dce2029

The targetting of religion, which has no national or ethnic boundary, is just mindboggling, whether it is a database or a ban on immigration.

It seems to me to be some sort of way to send a message to extreme Islamic groups like ISIS, but the reality of it is extremely Nazi-ish, name-and-shame-ish, and demoralizing.

Think that this type of thing would not happen in reality? The TSA already, beginning with Obama administration, will ask for social media handles on your immigration forms.

Crossing borders is becoming increasingly invasive of your personal privacy.
